A user who has limited knowledge of an artists' name, but recognizes their face would have a better time playing the game if the artists'
photos were displayed along with their names. Therefore, as a user, displaying the artists' photos taken from their Spotify profiles
will make the game more enjoyable to play and increase the recognizability of more music artists.
