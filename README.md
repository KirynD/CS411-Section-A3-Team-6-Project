A travel planning tool that gives a route matching specific parameters (least expensive, fastest, price range, etc), and then makes a Spotify playlist that matches the travel time given based upon the location (analyzes Spotify chart for that place to create a playlist of popular songs).


A Higher/Lower type of game
  Given two songs from spotify, which song has more plays. There can also be a hint button that gives information about the song/artist.This does not have to be # of plays of a song from spotify. This includes but is : populations of countries, # of words in a book, # of twitter followers, etc. There probably an API out there that takes numbers from Spotify. We can even include categories, so we can do # of plays and world populations.
