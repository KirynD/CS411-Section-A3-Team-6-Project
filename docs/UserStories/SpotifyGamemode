On the main menu screen, the user will select the field signifying that they want to play the Spotify gamemode.
Then, the game will immediately start, displaying the first two randomly generated artists. The
game will continue, incrementing the score by one for every correct guess. The game will stop
when the user gives an incorrect guess, and their score will be reset to zero. The user will have
unlimited time to make their guess. The user can play the game logged in and not logged in. More
information can be found in the Logged-in user and Not logged-in user stories.
