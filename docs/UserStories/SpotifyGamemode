On the main menu screen, the user will select the field signifying that he wants to play the Spotify gamemode.
Then, they will be shown a popup and be prompted to select between two fields: regular or easy mode. In regular
mode, the player will be given two randomly selected songs from a verified artist on Spotify and will have to guess
which one has more total streams. They have unlimited time to make a guess in a round. When the player gets a correct
answer, their score will increase by one. The correctly answered song will then be compared to another randomly selected
song, and the game keeps going. When the user gives an incorrect answer, their game ends and the score is recorded and
shown to them in a popup. Then they can decide to play another round or go back to the main menu. In easy mode, the player
is allowed three incorrect guesses before the game ends. Incorrect guesses do not increment the score by one but another
round starts after, similar to regular mode. High scores can be recorded for future play sessions by logging in. More
information can be found in the Logged-in user and Not logged-in user stories. There is a separate leaderboard for regular and easy mode.
