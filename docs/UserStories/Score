While the user plays the game, their current score will be displayed. This allows the user
to keep track of their progress in the game, as well as try to improve from previous
plays of the game. The ability to keep track of the score keeps the user having fun
as they play more iterations of the game since they can try to improve their score, and as
a user I would want to know my progress.
