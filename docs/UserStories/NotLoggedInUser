Someone who wants to play the game without logging in to their Twitter account. On the main menu screen, they
will not select the field asking them to log in to their Twitter account. Rather, they just want to play the game
regardless of whether they want to record their scores or not. The user will just start the game. Throughout their play session, their 
current score will always be displayed. This score will go away after the user closes the game application. They will have the option to log in
using the log in button after each game. More information can be found in the Logged-in user story.
