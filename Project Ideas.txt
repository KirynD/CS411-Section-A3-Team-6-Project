Main idea: A game based off The Higher Lower Game. Given two songs from Spotify, guess which song has more plays/streams. A correct guess will allow the player to take the winning song from the previous round and then compare it to another randomly selected song; increase player's score by one for a correct guess. This iterates until an incorrect guess and the game ends. Users can log in to their Twitter account to share their highest score. User information on games played and scores can be stored in a database format. Can utilize the Spotify RESTful API to collect song streaming numbers and album cover. There can also be an additional category of the game where users guess between two Twitter profiles and which has more followers between them. This will utilize the Twitter API to collect follower numbers as well as profile pictures.

Backup idea: A travel planning tool that gives asks for a starting location and destination which then routes given user-speciifed parameters (least expensive, fastest, price range, etc.). Then, a Spotify playlist is made that matches the travel time of said route and contains songs that are popular in the destination country or city. If a flight is delayed, then the application can append songs to the end of the playlist to increase the length of said playlist, similar to what Spotify does. These can be the the most popular songs currently or a vintage playlist. The Spotify RESTful API can be used to gather data on streaming numbers, song region popularity, etc. There should exist APIs that have data on flight paths. A database component will collect flights and playlists. Users can log in to their Spotify account to save the playlist or log in to their Twitter to share it.
