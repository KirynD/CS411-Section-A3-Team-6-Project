Someone who wants to play the game without logging in to their Twitter account. On the main menu screen, they
will not select the field asking them to log in to their Twitter account. Rather, they just want to play the game
regardless of whether they want to record their scores or not. The user will just click on one of two options: the
Twitter or the Spotify gamemodes. Throughout their play session, information such as high score, average score and total
number of games played will not be recorded as they are not logged in. However, they will be able to see a temporary high
score displayed in the bottom left corner of the screen. This score will go away after the user closes the game application,
but they will have the option to save the high score by logging in. They will have the option to log in if after each game is
played prompted by a popup. More information can be found in the Logged-in user story.
