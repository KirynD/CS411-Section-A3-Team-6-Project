 Someone can log in to their Twitter account if they want to record information on the games they play, such as a high score. 
 Upon opening the game, the user will see a main menu with a field allowing them to log in. If they decide to do so, a popup
 will appear asking them for their Twitter username as well as their password. After filling in the correct information, the
 player will be brought back to the main menu where they can select which game mode they want to play. If the player does get
 a high score after any game from this session, they will be able to share the high score if they want by Tweeting it out. The
 score will also be saved to their account and will be able to view it in following logged-in play sessions. Users with associated
 Twitter accounts will also have access to their total number of games played and average score. Those who have an account can view
 their highscore on a leaderboard, filled with other players who have accounts.
