I can't record any audio, so I am going to type out a transcript explanation of our two videos and explain what they are. 
We have a React frontend, and a Node.JS and express backend. For our Twitter login component, we were able to implement
it successfully, as shown in the Twitter demo. It uses the Twitter API, and uses a MongoDB to store user information.
Unfortunately, when combined with the frontend app, the app itself no longer works. We recorded two separate videos
for this reason, one of the Twitter login component and the other of our frontend app. The app, when opened, gives a start
button which can be pressed to begin the game. The game will randomly generate two random Spotify artists using the API
and display their picture. The user has to pick which one has more followers using the button of the same name. If they
get the answer correct, their score goes up by one, and another random artist replaces the artist who lost the round.
If they get it incorrect, their score goes back to 0 and the game restarts.
